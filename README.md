## 🧠 What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a standardized framework that allows AI models, agents, and tools to communicate and share structured information through a common protocol.  
Your Weather MCP Server acts as an **MCP-compatible data provider**, exposing weather endpoints that can be queried by models in a consistent, machine-readable way.
